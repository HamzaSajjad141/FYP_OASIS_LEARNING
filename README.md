# Oasis-Learning

This Project is a Personalized Video Generator, a web-based application developed using `HTML5`, `CSS3`, `JavaScript`, `Django`, `Python`, `SQLite`, and `VSCode`.

It is designed to allow users to `input queries`, `images`, and `specify the desired language`, `tone`, and `person/teacher`.

The application then generates a personalized video where the query is addressed in the selected language, tone, and by the chosen person/teacher.
